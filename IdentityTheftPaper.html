  The advent of newer and more sophisticated technology has brought about a variety of changes that help us become more efficient in everyday life. 
For instance the proliferation of the internet and even email has allowed us to send information instantly over a server versus waiting weeks to receive it by mail. 
What used to take several days now takes several minutes. However with the new proliferation and improvements over technology there is always a downside. 
The key downside is that when a large amount of personal information is downloading to servers the security of such information can be compromised.  
When this information is compromised third parties can steal information either to sell to websites or impersonate someone else in order pay for items with funds that are not theirs and the original owner receives the bill. 
This normally is just the start of a downward spiral that causes a person’s reputation to be ruined and lowers the person’s quality of life to the point where it will literally take years to repair the damage that took the third party less than a month to create. 
</p>
<p>  In this paper I will explore the details of <strong>Identity Theft</strong>, a crime that has been ion the rise and still rising with the advent of newer technology. 
I will be begin by first defining what constitutes as Identity theft, then define and explain the various categories of identity theft and examples of how they are used and how you can recognize them. 
The following section will then explore various ways that people can steal identity ranging from simple tasks to more complex. Of course this section would not be complete without offering ways in which you can protect yourself against Identity theft. 
The next section will present a brief statistic in accordance with the <strong>Federal Trade Commission</strong> on the number of cases and costs to the public and to the government of identity theft. The next main part of the paper will explore that current public policy that the government has in place to combat identity theft. 
Upon further explanation the paper will go into the positives and negatives of the public policy as well as the overall cost to implement it. 
The following section will the explore my own proposals for policy against Identity theft, overall I present more stringent punishment for those that are caught trying to steal someone’s Identity as well as the leniency for the victims to make it easier for them to get their life back to where it was before their Identity was stolen. 
I will also present the positives, negatives and the overall costs in order to implement the policies. 
The paper is by no means touches on every aspect of Identity theft, but is merely a guide to the basics of the <strong>crime, the methodology, defense against the crime, and public policy that is in place,</strong> as well as policies recommended to help further combat the threat.

<div id="what">
<p>  Identity theft is the assumption of another person’s identity through print, digital, voice, or physical impersonation with the intent to defraud the victim for their own benefit.<strong>(ftc.gov)</strong> It is hard to say why a person would defraud another person, but it can most certainly be distilled down to economic gain, the refusal to come about their possessions honestly, or they want to the easy way to live life. 
Despite the reasons or motivations it is still a heinous crime in which sometimes irreversible damage is done not only to the victim’s reputations, but also their way of life. 
Ironically there are so many forms of Identity theft that it can sometimes be hard to recognize some of them. 
An example of case of Identity theft involves anyone that was defrauded in excess of <strong>$1,000,000.</strong>
The criminal bought credit cards, applied for loans, motorcycles, houses, apartments, opened accounts, and even filed for bankruptcy in the victim’s name. 
All this was done by stealing pieces of the person’s identity that was unknowingly left out in the open for the criminal to steal. 
The victims were not aware of the crime until they received their credit card statement  or they were contacted by a debt collector only to realize that the reason they were unaware of the charges was because the criminal got a hold of either their credit cards or bank account number and changed the mailing address. 
However the most painful and stressful part about combating identity theft is the time and money spent trying to repair it. 
In an example case of this caliber the victim would have had to spend an additional <strong>$100,000</strong> and several years just trying to repair the damage done by the criminal. 
</p>

<p>
  According to the FTC, <strong>"National and State Trends in Fraud and Identity Theft"</strong>, credit card fraud was the most common complaint, followed by phone utilities, bank, and employment fraud. 
<strong>9.3 million Americans</strong> are subject to identity theft each year and that number changes when the advent of newer technology. 
Businesses loss approximately <strong>$52.6 billion dollars</strong> to identity theft each year and collectively individuals loss approximately <strong>$5 billion each year. (ftc.gov)</strong>
Identity theft is a serious crime. Some victims as a result of Identity theft lose out on job opportunities, loans for cars and houses, and sometimes even penalized for a crime that they didn’t commit because the criminal gave their information to the police. 
In addition to a tarnished personal and financial reputation, a person can have a criminal record as well despite having a clean record for several years or their entire life prior to the incident.

</nav>


<div id="types">
<p>
  There are four main categories of Identity Theft: <strong>Financial, Criminal, Identity, and Business.</strong> <strong>(Anderson, Salinger, 2008)</strong> 
Financial theft occurs when the criminal uses personal information to apply for telephone service, credit cards, and loans, buy merchandise and/or lease cars or apartments. 
The victim will receive bills for unauthorized charges as a result of the criminal changing the billing address on the statements however the bill will still be billed to the original owner of the account. 
The best way to combat this type of theft is to regularly check your banking, credit card statement to catch the charges early so that it will be easier to reimburse for the charges and the criminal can be arrested. 
It is also advised to cancel the credit card and apply for a new one to prevent further fraudulent charges. 
The second category is criminal theft. Criminal theft occurs when the criminal uses personal information and then gives that information to law-enforcement officials during/after committing of a crime. 
The victim is then mistakenly arrested for a crime they did not commit and the crime is on their record even if it was proven that they were innocent. 
This can affect job opportunities, loans, and even personal relationships. 
The best way to combat this is to invest in a shredder. Any documents outside those needed to identify you such as bills, loan statement; credit card offers should be destroyed rather than thrown away in the recycle bin. 
If you receive mail my suggestion would be to either invest in a personal mail from the post office in one o the mail boxes that require a key, or have a slot mail box installed on your front screen door so the mail carrier will put it in the slot versus just leaving it in the mail box. 
Another suggestion is that if you already have a mailbox invest in a secure mailbox, which allows the mail carrier to put mail in but only allows the owner, you to take the mail out with a key and/or lock to prevent people from searching your mailbox.
The third category is Identity theft in which the criminal uses personal information to establish a new life, complete with the necessary cards, permits, and papers.
In this theft a person normally with a criminal background who is unable to obtain employment, loans, car, house, etc will steal the personal information of someone else to recreate themselves as someone else to pass background checks. 
<br><br>  
<p>This is a two-sided coin because there are <strong>two forms</strong> of this that occurs. One is merely falsifying your identity to create a new life and obtain services by stealing the identity of someone that is living, however another form of this is commonly called “ghosting” Ghosting is stealing the identity of the deceased person that is the same age as the criminal. <strong>(Wells,2002)</strong> 
This works because the birth certificate in public records will lie dormant on public record and sometimes when a person dies, of there were no next of kin, close relatives or friends the person will not have a death certificate filed and on public record that person will still be registered as being alive. 
Therefore in this case the criminal resumes the life of a person who has no family ties or close friends and lives the life of the identity of someone that is deceased for the same purpose albeit not to steal the possessions, but merely to erase the existence of their old lives.<br><br> 
<p>
There are sites and organizations for deceased. One prime example would be programs that are in charge of managing organs for donors. One company that was in charge of this would publish personal information about the deceased. 
It wasn’t until the proliferation of identity theft of the deceased that it became a concern. Everything short of person’s security number was published making an easy alibi for any would be criminal to assume the identity. 
It wasn’t a concern because the person was dead however if the person is a close relative then that can lead identity theft effect the lives of living relatives that were closely related to the deceased. 
One example of this would be if a criminal assumed the identity of a deceased husband or wife then once the identity is successfully assumed then it could be used reap benefits of marriage such as insurance and tax refunds afforded to married couples. 
Another example could be to assume the identity of a deceased that might have been a beneficiary of will and testament and use that to receive funds or an estate. 
The best way to protect against this is reapply for social security and your birth certificate each time you move to a new residence. 
This way the office has a record of your recent activity as well as the date and social security number of your person. 
If the public record doesn’t match the person trying to steal your identity then there would be a red flag in the record and most often they would ask for information that the criminal more than likely will not have. 
If you have a relative or close friend that has died make sure their obituary is published and that a death certificate is filled in public record to prevent the criminal from claiming your deceased family member/friend as their own identity.
The last category is business theft. Business theft occurs when personal information from and individual or a business is used to open credit cards and bank accounts are opened in the name of a business and are then used to order merchandise or acquire loans. 
<br><br>
<p>
An example of this could be likened to extortion. A criminal organization in exchange to protect the business from the crime they impose on unwanted businesses offers their services. 
In exchange they have a controlling stake in the business and enforce fees that must be paid each month in order for their continued protection against their own extortion and the extortion of outside criminal organizations. 
Sometimes these fees go up and the business owners authorizes charges to the point where the business goes into debt driving it out of business and the organization moves onto the next business that it wants to extort. 
In translating this to an individual criminal who want to extort from a business they do one of two things either they pose as an employee or bribe an employee who has access to classified information relating to the business. 
This personal information can contain business accounts, employee benefits and payroll information. A criminal could pose as an employee to obtain checks or use business authorization to withdraw from business. 
In protecting yourself from this as a business I would suggest that each employee an individual identification badge with a picture identifying the employee. 
In addition the employee should also be required to a have a pass code whenever they enter any part of the company including the restricted areas. 
Is should be clear in the employee rulebook about who is authorized to access these records and any additional identification that is required. 
In addition to the other layers of security there should an electronic as wells as print records of what records was accessed, by whom, and for what purpose. 
In order for the individual to protect themselves whenever you apply for payroll always get the option for either direct deposit or an in office pickup. The option of having your paycheck mailed to you is risky today because of the criminal theft mentioned earlier in the paper. 
Criminals can skim information from a paycheck. This information includes full name address, account number and even the name and number of the bank. This can be used is steal information from the account and either withdraw money from the account of cash the check. 
Skilled criminals would even go so far as to forge a false identification card so to ensure the banks that they are indeed you and cash deposit the checks. 
This can also work at check cashing places as well as most places just ask for identification in order to cash your checks while only a few will ask for the social security number in addition to it.

<strong><ins>How is an Identity is Stolen?</strong></ins>
</div>

<div id="theft">
<p>
  There are seemingly countless ways that an identity can be stolen. Some of the more well know ways that don’t require any effort include: searching through a person’s trash, overhearing a person give out personal information, overlooking someone’s shoulder as they fill out forms or input information in a system and searching government and public websites. 
Personal information is given out and displayed on a daily basis you just have to know where to look. 
The aforementioned methods of stealing a person’s identity are readily available to anyone provided they know what they are looking for. 
In order to combat these basic methods simply requires awareness on the part of the potential victim. For instance be careful of what you throw away, anything with even a tiny bit of personal information should be either shredded or burned. 
Investing in a paper shredder would be your best approach in making sure that your personal information in print media is not seen, however there is a cheaper way to do this. You can simply invest in a tin bucket, or some sort of fire resistant container and burn the physical evidence of the documents. 
You could put the entire document as a whole in the container or you could cut up and tear the documents into smaller pieces to ensure a faster burn rate. 
In order to prevent people from getting into your mailbox as mentioned earlier in the paper would be to invest in a security mailbox or have a slot installed in a locked screen door so the mail inside your residence versus outside in the open. 
In order to prevent people from overhearing you giving out personal information make sure that whenever you are on the phone with services that require personal information make sure your are in a secluded, quiet area.
If this is not an option and if you are still worried about people overhearing you obtain the number from the service, and/or give the service a number or time to reach you so you can discuss your business within the safety of your home. 
In order to address situations where you are in a position in which someone can look over your shoulder always make sure the area is clear whenever you fill out forms. Always choose to sit in an area where your back is against the wall so you can see the area immediate around you. 
If someone tries to look at your form you can easily move to another location. <br><br>
<p>When using an ATM machine make sure to check underneath the keypad and the card insert to make sure there are no devices that feel or look out of place. 
These are often scanning storage devices used to obtain credit card numbers and pin numbers. Whenever possible use the ATM at your local bank or withdraw needed funds from the account from the bank directly. 
For an added layer of security you can always invest in a prepaid card which you can add funds to ensure you are not carrying a lot of cash around in your wallet. There are various places that you can go to purchase prepaid cards, but a lot times these same places provide a service that can upload funds to the card or you can call the number on the prepaid card in order to do so. 
Lastly personal information about a person is on government and public websites. These records provide a database for law abiding citizens and criminals to scan for information about anyone anywhere in the United States. These databases provide records of everything from marriage, divorce, birth, death, criminal records, and backgrounds checks on anybody within its database. 
Although some charge for the service there are some that are free for anyone to view. These sites range from townships, counties, cities, states, and even countries. 
The security of this system is that there are so many records that there are quite a few that are outdated. 
There are services that allow you to request information, although there are measures to protect against it such as forwarding requests to the director and having a written request for the record and the nature of the request.
 Some will even contact you to ensure that the person has permission access the information, though these measures are taken when the record is being created in the system. When accessing your public records you can determine whether or not it is available online. 
Most records are only available offline so only a small fraction of public records are accessible online even if you pay for the service.

<strong><ins>Public Policy on Identity Theft</strong></ins>
</div>

<div id="policy">
<p>

  <strong>The Federal Trade Commission</strong>, otherwise known as the <strong>FTC</strong> is a government organization that is primarily a consumer protection agency that enforces federal laws designed to help consumers and victims of identity theft. 
Due to numerous incidents of Identity theft and no recourse through the law to combat it Congress passed <strong>The Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act</strong>, sometimes called <strong>“The Identity Theft Act”</strong> in 1998. Under this act identify theft was a separate crime against the person whose identity was stolen. 
This broadened the scope of the offense to include the misuse of personal information as well as documents. <strong>(ftc.gov)</strong> The Federal Trade Commission enforces these laws. 
The Identity Theft Act strengthens the laws governing identity theft making it a federal crime that is punishable to the fullest extent of the law whether at the local or state level. 
The Act further addresses the problem of identity theft by focusing more on the victim along with punishing the criminal. The Act addresses the needs of the victim through the Federal Trade Commission. 
There are three methods in which the FTC enforces advocating for its victims. They first log and maintain records for receipts of complaints from victims. They provide victims with informational materials in protecting themselves in the future which is readily available free to anyone who wants them. 
Lastly they refer complaints to appropriate entities, including major national consumer reporting and law enforcement agencies. <strong>(ftc.gov)</strong> it is often recommended that if you are a victim of identity theft to call as soon as you find out. 
Most people that contact the Federal Trade Commission, nearly 80% are already victims of identity theft, so it is recommended that in order to prevent further damage you cancel any credit cards, call the three main credit bureau’s to ensure that a fraud alert is placed on your account, and finally file a police report with the local and state police as they would have a better chance of actually apprehending the criminal.  
Since 1999 the cases of identity theft have risen the FTC has received reports from hospitals, schools, retail stores, private corporations, etc and other employers whose personnel records had been compromised by an identity thief. 
Although identity theft is always on the rise there is only one way to significantly lower your chances of being a victim and that is awareness of where all your personal information is being sent and having record of any and all transactions.
The positives aspect of this public policy is that it addresses the problem through education and prevention. The policy makes Identity theft a federal crime which translates in stricter sentencing for those that are accused and convicted of any crime under the category of Identity theft. 
The government also created an agency to help victims specifically with this problem i.e. The Federal Trade Commission. The agency keeps records of all complaints and transfers the complaints to the appropriate officials and offices as well as offering as a guide through the process. 
The agency also supplies information on steps to preventing information such as the ones introduced in the earlier part of this paper.<br><br>
<p>
The negative aspects of this policy is the cost that despite its best efforts identity theft is on the rise and makes that makes it more difficult to combat due to advent of more sophisticated and advance technologies. 
Since the policy has been enacted there have been an Increasing number of fraud alerts on consumer files and an increased number of fraud allegations. 
There have also been an increased number of cases that have been brought to trial and that translates to an increased in overall cost to taxpayers in order to bring the case to trial render judgements fort the cases. 
When the identity theft claims individuals that person losses funds and a quality of life, however when an employer falls victim to identity theft then that not only translates to loss of profits and a tarnished reputation for consumers, it is a loss of goods, services, funds for the states in which they operate and more importantly loss of several jobs of the people in which they employ. This compromise is especially damaging for the employees because identity theft of a business can affect benefits such as insurance and retirement accounts depending on the skill of the criminal. Identity theft can be compared to an object that is dropped in a lake. Once the object is dropped it creates a ripple effect that touches all corners of the lake. Every part is affected for an undetermined length of time depending on the size of the object and the impact. As a result of this some parts of the lack will not feel the effects of the ripple until long after the item is dropped. Identity theft is very much the same way in how one person can steal the information of a person or entity and affects will either be felt immediately or have a delayed reaction. Depending on the extent of the damage and the resources of victim it can take years to repair the damage.
Although overall the policy is good for addressing a specific problem there are some recommendations I would put forth in order to be more effective with the policy. 
There are also recommendations for victims and future victims of Identity theft in order to prepare for the problem once it comes. <br><br>
<p>
The first change to the policy I would recommend would be that people found guilty of identity theft, require registration similar to those accused of being a sex offender so the public knows. Sex offenders must register whenever they move to a new town, city, or state. This should be case with convicted identity thieves so people are on alert whenever they risk divulging personal information. The second recommendation would be Impersonators who were found guilty and served their sentence would have a mark on their record that prevents them from being hired on any job that requires them to handle personal/confidential information. Identity theft occurs in large part because personal information is readily available to the public and that there are few ways to retrieve the information without any skill or specialized equipment. This can be done by searching through your trash specifically the recycle bin that only accepts cardboard, plastics and paper, searching through a person’s mailbox during typical work hours, and searching public records. The mark on a convicted identity thief’s record would act as a red flag for employers that hiring the person would be an increased risk to the business. This policy in theory would help to identity the criminals and more than likely discourage future criminals in the same practice if the crime would follow them for the rest of their life. The third recommendation is that there should be a series of numbers that correspond to your SSN to use instead of giving out the actual number to do required background checks. All employment agencies, companies require the social security number however there have been times where you will either have to fill out form which your number is clearly visible at the top of the form and left in stacks on the front desk for any passerby to see. Another instance occurs when an employer or interviewer will ask for your social security number within an earshot of a busy office; this alerts any would-be criminals to listen in on the conversation. If this policy is enacted it would simply substitute the security number for a cross reference number that can be searched in government database that the person has the option of whom they make it available to. This permission can be granted either by calling a specified number or filling out a form signed by the citizen that authorizes any registered employer to obtain your social security number for the purpose of doing a background check. Another suggestion would be to require by federal law that victims of identity are absolved of all debt incurred by the impersonator, instead the debt incurred will be added to the sentencing and the bail amount. The case of identity theft will be made clear on a person’s record and the outcome of the case to prevent discrimination by employers. 
 <br><br>
 <p>Whenever you apply for employment they almost always do a background check and anything from a bad credit score to a felony can be the determining factor in whether or not a person is offered employment. This policy would allow people to recover quickly from Identity theft and allow them to rebuild their lives. The final policy I would propose would be a regulation on ATM’s it would be a federal law that ATM machines should be equipped with an ID scanner. This scanner verifies Identification from a state ID after inputting your pin number to prevent stolen ATM cards from being used.
The positive aspects of these policies is that they address some of the ways we unknowingly leak our personal information by making citizens and employers aware of simple things they can do to safeguard themselves.
However the negative aspect of enacting these policies would be the overall costs. The major factors are the national deficit, high unemployment, and major cities making cuts. 
The money to enact the policies have to come from somewhere and unless the policies are enacted or at the very least an campaign is launched in order to raise public awareness then the United States is fighting an uphill battle when it comes to Identity theft.
